I based this off of a video I saw of a guy who made a neural network in C. Mine is "rudimentary" ðŸ¤“ b/c I only know the basics of C. He lost me at hidden layers (ik what they r but like coding them is different ig I didn't understand them enough?). I need to make a grid module if I want to continue this. <---- Maybe ue my matrix module and restart?
